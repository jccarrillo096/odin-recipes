        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Mix flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt in
                large bowl. Beat butter and brown sugar in large bowl with
                electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add
                molasses, egg, and vanilla; mix well. Gradually beat in flour
                mixture on low speed until well mixed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press dough into a thick, flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap.
                Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll dough on
                a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut into
                gingerbread men shapes with a 5-inch cookie cutter. Place
                gingerbread men 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are set and
                just begin to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for
                1 to 2 minutes, then remove to wire racks to cool completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Decorate cooled cookies as desired. Store cookies in airtight
                container up to 5 days.
